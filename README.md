## AMAAS
This repository contains tutorials, exercises, and R code for AMAAS workshops

These materials were developed by Dr. Jaap Saers (University of Cambridge) and myself as part of a graduate level seminar on analytical/quantitative methods in anthropological sciences.

For the time being, you can find gentle introductions to R, and using two R packages (dplyr and ggplot2) for working with anthropometric data. I hope to add more material in the future for rmarkdown, working with and visualizing GIS data in R, and an introduction to Bayesian statistics.

These exercises use an open-access database available at https://github.com/geanes/bioanth. Instructions for downloading this dataset can be found at this link.

## Current Material

An introduction to R/ R Studio
* Anatomy of RStudio
* Importing data
* Data formats
* Exploratory data analysis
* Data cleaning
* Installing and using packages
* Executing (extremely) basic statistical tests

"dplyr" is used for manipulating data. It provides an intuitive, grammar-like framework for doing things like exploring and cleaning data.

"ggplot2" is used for visualizing data. It provides a set of highly customizable tools for creating excellent graphics.
