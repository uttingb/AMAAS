# AMAAS
This repository contains tutorials, exercises, and R code for AMAAS workshops

These tutorials and exercises were developed by Dr. Jaap Saers (University of Cambridge) and myself as part of a gradaute level seminar on analytical/quantitative methods in anthropological sciences.

For the time being, you can find gentle introductions to using two R packages (dplyr and ggplot2) for working with anthropometric data. I hope to add more material in the future for rmarkdown, working with and visualizing GIS data in R, and an introduction to Bayesian statistics.

"dplyr" is used for manipulating data. It provides an intuitive, grammar-like framework for doing things like exploring and cleaning data.

"ggplot2" is used for visualizing data. It provides a set of highly customizable tools for creating excellent graphics.
